## Computer
A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#First_computing_device>[source]</a>.

## Computer Science
Computer Science is the study of processes that interact with data and that can be represented as data in the form of programs. It enables the use of algorithms to manipulate, store, and communicate digital information <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science>[source]</a>. Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing <a href=https://undergrad.cs.umd.edu/what-computer-science>[source]</a>.
* **FACTS:**
  - A computer scientist studies the theory of computation and the design of software systems <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science>[source]</a>.
  - Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application <a href=https://undergrad.cs.umd.edu/what-computer-science>[source]</a>.
  - Computer science is the study of both computer hardware and software design <a href=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/592/computer-science>[source]</a>.

## Fields
Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. Computational complexity theory is highly abstract, while computer graphics emphasizes real-world applications <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science>[source]</a>.
So, to summarize, the discipline of computer science has evolved into the following 15 distinct fields: <a href=https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science>[source]</a>
* Algorithms and complexity
* Architecture and organization
* Computational science
* Graphics and visual computing
* Human-computer interaction
* Information management
* Intelligent systems
* Networking and communication
* Operating systems
* Parallel and distributed computing
* Platform-based development
* Programming languages
* Security and information assurance
* Software engineering
* Social and professional issues

## History
 The history of computer science began long before our modern discipline of computer science, usually appearing in forms like mathematics or physics <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_science>[source]</a>. The beginnings of computer science as a study go back to the 1940s, when the first digital electronic computers were developed for use in in World War II. The field has since seen many major achievements including the digital revolution and establishment of the Internet, as well as the use of computers in science and math <a href=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/592/computer-science>[source]</a>.
 * **Prehistory**: The earliest known tool for use in computation was the abacus, developed in the period between 2700–2300 BCE in Sumer <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_science#cite_note-3>[source]</a>.
 * **Binary logic**: In 1702, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed logic in a formal, mathematical sense with his writings on the binary numeral system. In his system, the ones and zeros also represent true and false values or on and off states. But it took more than a century before George Boole published his Boolean algebra in 1854 with a complete system that allowed computational processes to be mathematically modeled <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_science#cite_note-Tedre2014-18>[source]</a>.
 * **First computing device**: Charles Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the "father of the computer", he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#cite_note-16>[source]</a>.
 * **FACTS:**
   - Charles Babbage is often regarded as one of the first pioneers of computing. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_science#cite_note-Charles_Babbage-25>[source]</a>.
   - In 1837 Charles Babbage first described his Analytical Engine which is accepted as the first design for a modern computer <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_science#cite_note-17>[source]</a>.
   - Ada lovelace is honoured as the pioneer of programming concept for broughting Charles Babbage the concept of programming to use in his analytical engine <a href=https://www.britannica.com/technology/Ada-computer-language>[source]</a>.
   - Ada lovelace was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace>[source]</a>.
   - Colossus, the first electronic digital programmable computing device, was used to break German ciphers during World War II <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#First_computing_device>[source]</a>.
   - The world's first electronic digital computer, the Atanasoff–Berry computer, was built on the Iowa State campus from 1939 through 1942 by John V. Atanasoff, a professor of physics and mathematics, and Clifford Berry, an engineering graduate student <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_science#cite_note-38>[source]</a>.
   - Before the 1920s, computers (sometimes computors) were human clerks that performed computations. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_science#cite_note-19>[source]</a>.
   - Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#First_computing_device>[source]</a>.
